## Design System — NEVER DEVIATE FROM THIS

### Colors
```css
--navy:    #1a1a2e   /* Primary background, cards, headers */
--amber:   #f0a500   /* Primary accent, CTAs, highlights */
--white:   #ffffff   /* Card backgrounds, text on dark */
--green:   #2d6a2d   /* Positive values, net pay, success */
--red:     #c0392b   /* Negative values, deductions, danger */
--blue:    #4a90d9   /* Grade B loads, secondary info */
--light:   #f0f0f0   /* Page background */
--peach:   #fdf0e0   /* Mileage section background */
--mint:    #e8f5e9   /* Per diem / positive section background */
```

### Typography
- Labels: UPPERCASE, monospace (`font-family: monospace`), `letter-spacing: 1px`,
  `font-size: 11–12px`, color: muted/gray
- Values: Bold, `font-size: 16–24px` for normal, `font-size: 28–36px` for hero metrics
- Page titles: Bold uppercase, `font-size: 20–24px`

### Components
```css
/* Card */
border: 2px solid var(--navy);
border-radius: 8px;
padding: 16px 20px;
background: white;

/* Primary Button (amber) */
background: #f0a500;
color: #1a1a2e;
font-weight: 800;
text-transform: uppercase;
letter-spacing: 1px;
border: 2px solid #1a1a2e;
border-radius: 4px;

/* Destructive Button (red) */
background: #c0392b;
color: white;

/* Section Header */
background: #1a1a2e;
color: #f0a500;
text-transform: uppercase;
```

### Background
Grid texture pattern on all page backgrounds (existing CSS class — reuse it).

### Money Format
Always display as `$X,XXX.XX` — use `.toLocaleString('en-US', {style:'currency', currency:'USD'})` or equivalent.
Always use a comma as the thousands separator — never a space (e.g. `5,059` not `5 059`).

### Dates
Display format: `MMM D, YYYY` (e.g. `Apr 6, 2026`) — use `format(date, 'MMM d, yyyy')` from date-fns.
Storage format: `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO).
All date picker buttons use calendar Popover pattern — never a plain `<input type="date">`.

### PRO Lock Badge (locked nav tiles)
```tsx
<div className="absolute top-2 right-2 flex items-center gap-1">
  <span className="brutal-mono text-xs font-bold px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded"
    style={{ background: '#f0a500', color: '#1a1a2e', fontSize: '10px', lineHeight: 1 }}>PRO</span>
  <Lock className="w-3 h-3 opacity-60" />
</div>
```
Applied to: SUMMARY, PER DIEM, IFTA tiles on the home dashboard.

## Data Architecture

All data is stored in Supabase PostgreSQL. User authentication via Supabase Auth.
Components fetch data via Supabase client with error handling and null checks.

### Key Tables

**profiles** — User profile settings
- name, email, phone, weeklyPeriod, annualGoal, weeklyGoal
- driverType: `'owner-operator'` | `'lease-operator'` | `'company-driver'`
- companyDeduction (% deducted for owner-operator and lease-operator)
- companyPayType: `'per_mile'` | `'percentage'` (company-driver only)
- companyPayRate: $/mile or % value depending on companyPayType
- leaseRatePerMile: cost per mile for lease-operator (deducted from net weekly)
- earlyAdopterBannerDismissed: boolean — persisted so banner never reappears after dismissal

**load_reports** — Truck loads with earnings data
- id, user_id, location_from, location_to, pickup_date, delivery_date, rate, company_deduction, driver_pay, week_period, date_added
- deadhead_miles, estimated_miles
- pickup_zip, delivery_zip, pickup_city_state, delivery_city_state (auto-populated via Google Maps)
- detention_amount (added when driver waits >2 hours — adds to gross before deductions)
- notes

**weekly_deductions** — Per-week typed deductions (FUEL, TOLL, MAINTENANCE, etc.)
- id, user_id, week_start, deduction_type, amount, updated_at

**weekly_extra_deductions** — One-off weekly expenses (free-text name)
- id, user_id, week_start, name, amount, date_added

**fixed_deductions** — Recurring weekly costs effective from a date
- id, user_id, name, amount, effectiveFrom

**weekly_mileage** — Odometer readings per week
- id, user_id, week_start (ISO date string), startMileage, endMileage
- leaseMilesCost (only populated for lease-operator drivers)

**subscriptions** — User subscription tier and status
- id, user_id, tier, startDate, endDate, trialUsed, earlyAdopter, earlyAdopterBannerDismissed
- stripeCustomerId, stripeSubscriptionId (set by webhook)

**personal_expense_types** — User-defined personal expense categories
- id, user_id, name

**personal_expenses** — Individual personal expense entries
- id, user_id, expense_type_id, amount, note, date

---

## Week ID / Week Start Calculation

Week starts are ISO date strings (`YYYY-MM-DD`) based on the user's `weeklyPeriod` setting.
Always use these helpers from `src/lib/weeklyPeriodUtils.ts`:

```typescript
getUserWeekStart(date, userProfile)  // → Date of week start for given date
getUserWeekEnd(date, userProfile)    // → Date of week end for given date
```

The `weeklyPeriod` field maps to a day-of-week offset:
- `'sunday'` → week starts Sunday (default)
- `'monday'` → week starts Monday
- (tuesday through saturday also supported)

Week period display strings (from `getWeeklyPeriodDisplay()` in `loadReportsUtils.ts`):
```
'sunday'    → 'Sun – Sat'
'monday'    → 'Mon – Sun'
'tuesday'   → 'Tue – Mon'
'wednesday' → 'Wed – Tue'
'thursday'  → 'Thu – Wed'
'friday'    → 'Fri – Thu'
'saturday'  → 'Sat – Fri'
```

## Subscription Tiers

| Tier | Price | Gated Features |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Free | $0 | Current week only, max 5 loads/week |
| Pro | $15 bi-weekly (every 2 weeks) **or** $300/yr (annual, marketed "2 months free") | Full history, IFTA, Per Diem, CSV export, YTD, AI Receipt Scanner, Weekly Forecast |
| Owner-Op | $30 bi-weekly (every 2 weeks) **or** $600/yr (annual, marketed "2 months free") | Everything in Pro + Dispatcher Book, Lane Analytics, Annual Goal |

Billing cycles are `'biweekly'` (Stripe `week` × 2) and `'annual'`. There is **no monthly** plan anymore.

**PRO features** (from `useSubscription.tsx`):
`ifta`, `perdiem`, `ytd`, `fullHistory`, `export`, `receipts`, `forecast`

**OWNER features** (in addition to Pro):
`dispatcher`, `laneAnalytics`, `annualGoal`, `multiTruck`

**90-day free Pro (all users):** Every new signup gets 90 days of full Pro free, granted **server-side** by a Postgres trigger (`handle_new_user_subscription` on `auth.users`) that creates the subscription row with `tier='pro'`, `early_adopter=true`, `end_date=now()+90 days`. The client never writes tier. A one-time welcome modal (`OnboardingWelcomeModal`) announces the 90 days free on first onboarding.

**Free-expiry reminders:** Escalating modals (`ExpirationReminderModal`) appear at 15 / 10 / 5 / 1 days before the free window ends (more urgent as it approaches; the 5- and 1-day ones warn about losing access/data). Each fires once — "shown" state is tracked in the `subscription_reminders` table. Buttons: "Get a Plan" (opens UpgradeModal) and Close. If the user subscribes during the free window, billing is **deferred** to the expiry date via Stripe `trial_end` (set in `create-checkout-session`), so they keep free access until then.

**Security (Phase 0):** The `subscriptions` table is **read-only to clients** (SELECT-only RLS). Tier/dates/stripe ids are written only by the Stripe webhook (service role) or the signup trigger. The single client-allowed mutation — dismissing the early-adopter banner — goes through the `dismiss_early_adopter_banner()` SECURITY DEFINER RPC. The old 7-day trial and all client-side tier writes have been removed.

**Scan cost guard:** `scan-receipt` requires a valid JWT and enforces a per-user daily cap (`try_consume_scan()` RPC + `usage_counters` table, 60/day) to prevent denial-of-wallet on the OpenAI calls.

**Paywall triggers:**
- Navigating to SUMMARY, IFTA, or PER DIEM (Free tier)
- Clicking "Scan Receipt with AI" (Free tier)
- Navigating to any week older than current (Free tier)
- Adding 6th load in a week (Free tier)

**UpgradeModal defaults:**
- Billing toggle defaults to `'annual'` (Annual shown first); annual shows a "2 MONTHS FREE" badge. Other option is `'biweekly'` ($15/$30 per 2 weeks).
- Cards always render side-by-side (2-column grid, no mobile stack)
- Pro features listed: Full load history, IFTA reports, Per Diem tracker, AI receipt scanner
- Owner-Op features listed: Everything in Pro, Dispatcher book, Lane analytics, Annual goal tracking
- No trial button (the 7-day trial was removed; everyone already gets 90 days free). While still in the free window the modal reassures: "You won't be charged until your free access ends on {date}."

## Stripe Integration

**Account:** `acct_1TLaKsDDJ9hkmBpw` (live mode)

### Products & Prices

| Plan | Billing | Price ID | Amount | Payment Link |
|------|---------|----------|--------|--------------|
| Pro | Bi-weekly | `price_1TjbA0DDJ9hkmBpwXxBFh2wR` | $15 / 2 wks | (Checkout via edge fn) |
| Pro | Annual | `price_1TjbA9DDJ9hkmBpwBnCVMIOU` | $300/yr | (Checkout via edge fn) |
| Owner-Op | Bi-weekly | `price_1TjbACDDJ9hkmBpwt1rRJlG8` | $30 / 2 wks | (Checkout via edge fn) |
| Owner-Op | Annual | `price_1TjbAEDDJ9hkmBpw8Vyi5x74` | $600/yr | (Checkout via edge fn) |

Products: TruckPay Pro `prod_UKFDC6PGYVFyy4`, TruckPay Owner-Op `prod_UKFDp0tlwSiXqk`. The 4 old monthly/annual prices ($14.99/$119.88/$29.99/$239.88) are **archived** in Stripe. Checkout always goes through the `create-checkout-session` edge function (not Payment Links).

### Edge Functions (all deployed)

1. **`create-checkout-session`** — Creates Stripe Checkout session (requires JWT; verifies caller via `auth.getUser()`)
   - Receives: `{ tier, billingCycle, successUrl, cancelUrl }` (tier `pro`|`owner`, cycle `biweekly`|`annual`)
   - Maps tier+cycle → price ID server-side; sets `subscription_data.trial_end` to the user's free-access `end_date` when still in the 90-day window (deferred billing)
   - Returns: `{ url }` — redirect to Stripe-hosted checkout
   - On success, Stripe redirects to `https://truckpay.app/?checkout=success`

2. **`stripe-webhook`** — Handles Stripe lifecycle events (deployed with `--no-verify-jwt`)
   - Always verify `stripe-signature` header using `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - Price-to-tier map:
     ```javascript
     const PRICE_TO_TIER = {
       // Current — bi-weekly + annual
       'price_1TjbA0DDJ9hkmBpwXxBFh2wR': 'pro',    // Pro Bi-weekly
       'price_1TjbA9DDJ9hkmBpwBnCVMIOU': 'pro',    // Pro Annual
       'price_1TjbACDDJ9hkmBpwt1rRJlG8': 'owner',  // Owner-Op Bi-weekly
       'price_1TjbAEDDJ9hkmBpw8Vyi5x74': 'owner',  // Owner-Op Annual
       // Legacy (archived) prices kept in the map for any old subscriptions
       'price_1TLainDDJ9hkmBpwH8pF7LXu': 'pro',
       'price_1TLaiqDDJ9hkmBpw2EEWTeIv': 'pro',
       'price_1TLaitDDJ9hkmBpwG40JiG5d': 'owner',
       'price_1TLaiwDDJ9hkmBpwZ1jI886S': 'owner',
     };
     ```

3. **`create-portal-session`** — Creates Stripe Customer Portal session for self-serve management

**Supabase secrets required:**
```bash
supabase secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY sk_live_...
supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET whsec_...
supabase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY sk-proj-...
```

## Pages / Views

The app uses `currentView` state in `Index.tsx` — no URL routing. All views rendered in place.

| View key | Name | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| `dashboard` | Home | Weekly snapshot, nav tiles, scan receipt, early adopter banner |
| `loads` | Load Reports | Week navigation, mileage, loads list, forecast card |
| `deductions` | Deductions | Fixed + weekly deductions |
| `forecast` | Earnings Summary | Multi-period analysis, charts, lane performance (PRO) |
| `expenses` | Personal Expenses | Personal expense categories (YTD default) |
| `perdiem` | Per Diem | IRS meal deduction calculator (PRO) |
| `ifta` | IFTA Report | Quarterly fuel tax report (PRO) |
| `settings` | Settings | Profile, goals, subscription, password, account deletion |

### Home Dashboard Layout (dashboard view)

1. Header: Logo + "TRUCKPAY / DRIVE SMART. EARN MORE." + Settings gear button
2. Weekly Snapshot card — Loads, Earned (gross), Expenses, Take-Home (net)
   - Shows weekly goal progress bar if `truckpay_weekly_goal` set in localStorage
   - Shows "Set a weekly goal →" link to Settings if not set
3. "Add your first load to get started" callout (amber button) — shown only when `weekSnapshot.loadCount === 0`
4. "SCAN RECEIPT WITH AI" button — shown only when `isFeatureAllowed('receipts')` is true
5. Early Adopter banner — shown when `earlyAdopter && !earlyAdopterBannerDismissed && endDate`
6. 6 nav tiles in 2-column grid (order matters):
   1. LOAD REPORTS — "Manage Loads"
   2. DEDUCTIONS — "Truck Expenses"
   3. PERSONAL EXPENSES — "Track Expenses"
   4. SUMMARY — "Earnings Breakdown" **[PRO badge if locked]**
   5. PER DIEM — "IRS Meal Deduction" **[PRO badge if locked]**
   6. IFTA REPORT — "Fuel Tax Filing" **[PRO badge if locked]**
7. Footer: `TRUCKPAY V2.3`

### Bottom Tab Bar (mobile only, `md:hidden`)

5 tabs: Loads | Expenses | **+ Add Load (center)** | Summary | More

"More" sheet contains: Personal Expenses, Per Diem, IFTA Report, Settings, Logout.

---

## LocalStorage

Only two keys are intentionally stored:
- `truckpay_weekly_goal` — user's weekly take-home goal (number string)
- `truckpay_annual_goal` — user's annual income goal (number string)

All other `truckpay_*` keys are stripped on app init (stale data guard) and all keys are cleared on logout/account deletion. **Never store subscription tier, early adopter status, or session data in localStorage** — those live only in the Supabase `subscriptions` table.

```typescript
const ALLOWED_LOCAL_KEYS = new Set(['truckpay_weekly_goal', 'truckpay_annual_goal']);
```

---

## Add Load Form

**Required fields:** Pickup ZIP, Delivery ZIP, Load Rate

**Auto-populated:** Pickup/Delivery city+state (via ZIP lookup), Estimated Miles (Google Maps distance)

**Always preselected:** Pickup Date and Delivery Date both default to `new Date()` (today) — they are actual `Date` objects in state, not strings. The calendar shows today highlighted on open.

**Optional fields** (behind "More Details" toggle):
- Company Deduction % (hidden for company-driver type)
- Detention Pay ($)
- Notes

**Chevron behavior:** `ChevronRight` when collapsed → `ChevronDown` when expanded.

**Submit button:** Amber (#f0a500), navy text (#1a1a2e), disabled until both ZIPs resolve successfully.

**Validation:** Rate > 0, both ZIPs exactly 5 digits, both ZIPs must successfully resolve before submit is enabled.

---

## AI Receipt Scanner

**Entry points:**
1. **Personal Expenses page** — "SCAN RECEIPT WITH AI" button
2. **Home dashboard** — "SCAN RECEIPT WITH AI" button (PRO users only) → destination picker first

**Destination picker (home only):** User chooses between:
- **Personal Expense** → saves to the `expenses` table (creates an `expense_types` row if needed). NOTE: the real tables are `expense_types` / `expenses` (NOT `personal_expense_types` / `personal_expenses`, which don't exist).
- **Truck / Work Expense** → non-fuel receipts save to `weekly_extra_deductions` keyed to the receipt's week. **Fuel receipts are auto-routed to IFTA** (see below).

**Flow:**
1. Take photo (mobile) or upload files (desktop)
2. Images compressed: max 1024px, JPEG 0.80 quality
3. Call `supabase/functions/scan-receipt/` with base64 image
4. Receive: `{ merchant, category, amount, date, notes, state, gallons, pricePerGallon }` — the last three are populated only for FUEL receipts (null otherwise)
5. Review/edit in modal (merchant, category, amount, date; for FUEL also state/gallons/$-per-gal)
6. Confirm → auto-create category if needed → save expense (or route fuel, below)

**Supported categories:** FUEL, TOLL, MAINTENANCE, PARTS, FOOD, LODGING, OTHER

### Fuel → IFTA auto-routing (Phase 1)

When a **FUEL** receipt is scanned via the home "Truck / Work Expense" path, it is matched to the specific load it belongs to and mirrored into that load's IFTA report. Logic lives in `src/lib/fuelRouting.ts`:

- **Match:** candidate loads = those whose `[pickup_date … delivery_date]` window contains the receipt date. One candidate → auto-match. Multiple → disambiguate by the fuel's **state** against each load's **full pass-through route states** (`states_miles` if present, else origin/destination/stop states, else the `calculate-ifta-miles` edge function). Zero → offer nearby loads (±10 days) in a picker.
- **Ambiguous / no match →** `FuelLoadPickerModal` lets the driver pick the load (or "Skip — just log as a truck expense"). Multiple pending fuel receipts are resolved one at a time.
- **Recording is "both" (not double-counting):** the fuel is written ONCE to `weekly_extra_deductions` (lowers take-home like any fuel cost) AND mirrored into `load_reports.fuel_purchases` (`{ state, gallons, pricePerGallon, amount, date, source: 'scan' }`) which IFTA aggregates for the quarterly fuel-tax report. `fuel_purchases` does NOT affect take-home, so it's a mirror, not a second deduction. "Skip" records only the weekly deduction.
- The IFTA page's own per-load fuel scanner (manual `EDIT` → scan) still works as before.

---

## Hardening notes (Phase 2)

- **Global error boundary:** `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` wraps `<App />` in `main.tsx`. A render error shows a brutal "TruckPay hit a snag" card with a Reload button instead of a white screen.
- **Non-receipt detection:** `scan-receipt` returns `isReceipt`; `ReceiptScanner` sets `notAReceipt` from it, so the "may not be a receipt" warning is live (it was previously dead code).
- **Scan timeout:** the OpenAI call in `scan-receipt` is time-boxed to 30s (AbortController → 504), plus auth + a 60/user/day cap + an 8MB payload guard + `mode` whitelist.
- **One load-save path:** both add-load entry points (`useLoadReports.handleAddLoad` for the Load Reports page and `Index.handleAddLoadFromHome` for the home/bottom-bar modal) build their DB rows from `src/lib/loadPersistence.ts` (`buildLoadReportRow` + `buildStopRows`). Do NOT hand-write a `load_reports`/`load_stops` payload inline — extend the shared builder so the two paths can't drift (they previously drifted on `week_period`, `deadhead_miles` parsing, and null-vs-empty fields).

---

## ZIP-to-ZIP Mileage Tracking

1. User enters pickup ZIP → `useZipLookup` calls `driving-distance` edge function → resolves city/state
2. User enters delivery ZIP → same lookup
3. Both resolved → distance calculated via Google Maps Distance Matrix → shown as Estimated Miles (editable)

**Key files:**
- `src/hooks/useZipLookup.ts` — state and edge function calls
- `supabase/functions/driving-distance/index.ts` — Google Maps API
- Timeout: 10-second AbortController per call

---

## Driver Types & Pay Calculations

Pay logic lives in `src/lib/loadReportsUtils.ts → calculateDriverPay()`.

| Driver Type | Pay Formula | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `owner-operator` | `(rate + detention) × (1 - companyDeduction%)` | Company takes % of gross |
| `lease-operator` | Same as owner-operator, PLUS `leaseMilesCost` deducted from weekly net | Lease cost = totalOdometerMiles × leaseRatePerMile |
| `company-driver` (per_mile) | `estimatedMiles × companyPayRate` | Detention does NOT affect pay |
| `company-driver` (percentage) | `(rate + detention) × companyPayRate%` | Percentage of gross including detention |

**Detention Pay:** Added to gross BEFORE applying deduction % for owner-op, lease-op, and company-driver (percentage). Stored as `detention_amount` per load. Shown on load cards as `+ $X detention`.

**Lease Miles Cost:** Only for lease-operator. Weekly: `totalOdometerMiles × leaseRatePerMile`. Stored in `weekly_mileage.leaseMilesCost`. Deducted at the weekly level, not per-load.

---

## Load Profitability Score

```javascript
function getLoadGrade(driverPay, miles) {
  const rpm = driverPay / (miles || 500); // 500mi fallback
  if (rpm >= 2.50) return { grade: 'A', label: 'EXCELLENT', color: '#2d6a2d' };
  if (rpm >= 2.00) return { grade: 'B', label: 'GOOD',      color: '#4a90d9' };
  if (rpm >= 1.50) return { grade: 'C', label: 'AVERAGE',   color: '#f0a500' };
  return              { grade: 'D', label: 'POOR',      color: '#c0392b' };
}
```

Shown as badge (48×48px max) on top-right of each load card with RPM: `$2.14/mi`.

---

## Per Diem Rates (IRS 2025)

```javascript
const PER_DIEM_FULL_DAY    = 80.00;  // Full day away from home
const PER_DIEM_PARTIAL_DAY = 59.50;  // First and last day (75%)
```

Pickup day = partial. Delivery day = partial. All days between = full.
Dates deduplicated across loads (driver may have multiple loads on same day).

---

## Authentication

**Login:** Email/password, Google OAuth, LinkedIn OAuth
**Social auth:** Users who sign in via Google/LinkedIn are redirected to Registration to complete their profile (driver type, company deduction, etc.) if `userProfile.driverType` is missing.

**Forgot Password:**
- "Forgot password?" link on login page
- Calls `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email, { redirectTo: window.location.origin + '/' })`
- User clicks magic link → app intercepts `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` auth event → shows `ResetPasswordPage`
- Never hardcode domain in `redirectTo` — always use `window.location.origin`

**Change Password (Settings):** Dedicated section with New Password + Confirm, validates match and min 6 chars.

**Supabase dashboard requirements:**
- Site URL: `https://truckpay.app`
- Redirect URLs allowlist: `https://truckpay.app/**`

## Period Filters

**ForecastSummary (Earnings Summary page):**
Default: `'ytd'` (Year-to-Date). Options: Last 2 weeks, Last 3 weeks, Last 4 weeks, YTD, Custom range.

**PersonalExpenses page:**
Default: `'ytd'` (Year-to-Date, Jan 1 → today). Options: Year to Date, Last 2 weeks, Last 3 weeks, Last 4 weeks, Custom range.

## UX Rules — Mobile First

- **Primary target:** iPhone/Android, one-thumb use, 375–390px wide
- **No horizontal scrolling** ever
- **Tap targets:** Minimum 44x44px for all buttons and interactive elements
- **No hover-only interactions** — all actions must work on touch
- **Bottom tab bar** — 5 tabs (Loads | Expenses | + Add Load | Summary | More), hidden on `md+` screens
- **Forms:** Pickup and delivery dates always preselected to `new Date()` as a `Date` object — driver changes only if needed
- **Load Rate field:** Show `$0.00` placeholder — never pre-fill a value
- **Empty states:** Every list must have a helpful empty state message, not blank space
- **Personal Expenses:** Forms collapsed by default — expand on tap (accordion pattern)

---

## Data Safety Rules

- Always test database migrations in development before deploying to production
- Always add error handling and null checks to Supabase queries
- Do not assume data exists — handle missing or incomplete records gracefully
- Never store sensitive data (subscription tier, session tokens) in localStorage

---

## Known Issues (Do Not Re-introduce)

1. **Mileage bug** — fixed in V2.1. Always sum per-week deltas (endMileage − startMileage per week). Never subtract first-week-start from last-week-end. Show `--` if endMileage is 0 or missing.

2. **Desktop layout** — app renders wide blank columns on desktop. Acceptable for now — mobile-only. Do not attempt a desktop redesign unless asked.

3. **pickupDate/deliveryDate type** — these must be `Date | undefined` objects in NewLoad state, never ISO strings. Using strings breaks the calendar `selected` prop and the date never shows as highlighted.

---

## Real User Context

The primary test user is **Akrom Aripov** — Sanjar's uncle, an active solo
truck driver. His account: `akrom1980@gmail.com`. He has 47+ real loads
entered since Jan 2026. His weekly gross averages ~$7,000–$9,000.
He is an Early Adopter (Pro free always).

When making UX decisions, ask: *"Can Akrom do this with one thumb while
parked at a truck stop?"* If no, simplify it.

## What NOT to Do

- Do NOT add desktop-specific layouts (mobile-only app)
- Do NOT use technical labels visible to users (see Language Rules above)
- Do NOT show a negative number for miles — show `--` if data incomplete
- Do NOT pre-fill Load Rate with a fake number
- Do NOT break existing Supabase data when adding new features or migrations
- Do NOT modify database schema without planning a migration
- Do NOT make unnecessary network calls — batch queries where possible
- Do NOT skip Stripe webhook verification — always validate `stripe-signature`
- Do NOT introduce new date input fields without using calendar picker Popover pattern
- Do NOT show the logout button as a top-level CTA — it belongs inside Settings only
- Do NOT allow raw code variable names (`SNAKE_CASE`, ALL_CAPS system strings) to render as user-facing text
- Do NOT use a space as a thousands separator — always use a comma (`5,059` not `5 059`)
- Do NOT expand all Personal Expense category forms by default — collapse them, expand on tap
- Do NOT truncate lane names in Lane Performance or IFTA — allow text to wrap
- Do NOT hardcode a domain in `redirectTo` for Supabase auth emails — always use `window.location.origin`
- Do NOT store subscription status, early adopter flag, or tier info in localStorage — DB only
- Do NOT initialize `pickupDate` or `deliveryDate` as ISO strings — use `new Date()` (Date object)
- Do NOT show the "Add your first load" callout unless `weekSnapshot.loadCount === 0`
- Do NOT show the "WELCOME, [NAME]" greeting on the Home screen
